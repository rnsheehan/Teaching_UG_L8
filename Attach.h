/*
cstdlib:
This header defines several general purpose functions, including dynamic memory management, random number generation, 
communication with the environment, integer arthmetic, searching, sorting and converting.

This library uses what are called streams to operate with physical devices such as keyboards, printers, terminals or with any other type of
files supported by the system. Streams are an abstraction to interact with these in an uniform way; 
All streams have similar properties independently of the individual characteristics of the physical media they are associated with.

iostream:
Header that defines the standard input/output stream objects

iomanip:
Header providing parametric manipulators, i.e. use it to change the parameters of the output stream

cmath:
declares a set of functions to compute common mathematical operations and transformations

using namespace std:
this tells MSVS that you want to use functions included in the standard library in your code
